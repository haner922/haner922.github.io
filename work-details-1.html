          Smart belt, WELT, is a fashionable healthcare wearable to monitor health data from the waist. <u>Slim sensors embedded within the belt invisibly track waist size, eating habits and activity levels while wearing.</u> Implementing technology on a daily worn object, users can naturally adapt to the product and service. It provides a seamless experience with tracking wearable that has never been seen, or worn, before.
          <br><br>
          Smart Belt is designed to manage health in everyday life while being flexible to fashion trends. It integrates healthcare service, technology and fashion accessory to provide an effective health care with familiar user experience. The unique shape of buckle represents the corporate signature to aid in brand recognition without being visually loud. While making a design statement on front view, all display and buttons that may grasp attention are eliminated, or placed hidden.

          <h4>1_ <br>Concept Development</h4>
          <h5>Problem: Health, Metabolic Syndrome </h5>
          Metabolic syndrome results from bad health habits, and is a shortcut to chronic disease and obesity. It raises chances of chronic disease such as diabetes and hypertension to four times. According to American College of Preventive Medicine, 1 in 3 adults are suffering with metabolic syndrome. To prevent metabolic syndrome, potential patients need accurate diagnosis and continuous treatment on a daily basis.
          Waist circumference is a powerful basis to detect overweight and obesity, and it is a major diagnostic indicator for various health risks. Treatment for metabolic syndrome is prescribed through controlled exercise, and eating habits.
          <br><br><br>

          <a href="images/work1/8.jpg" data-uk-lightbox title=""><img src="images/work1/8.jpg"></a> <br> <br>


          <h5>Problem: Market, Wearables UX</h5>
          Wearable health tracker is the most effective method to deliver healthcare providers the detailed and continuous log of patient's health habits that they accrue overtime. However the critical problems in existing fitness trackers make them difficult to provide customized treatment.
            <br><br>Although there are many fitness bands and smart watches that intend to monitor daily health logs,
            <br><br>1. 33% of activity trackers are <u>abandoned within 6 months</u> due to uncomfortable UX. 
            <br><br>2. Focus is only on tracking activity level (calorie burn), <u>only 1 of the 3 measures</u> that should be monitored to prevent weight gain.
            <br><br><br>

          <h4>2_ <br> System Solution </h4>
          <h5>Comprehensive Healthcare Service </h5>
          Monitoring unique health data obtained in waist area including waist circumference, food consumption pattern, activity and inactivity levels, the service aims to provide personalized healthcare with actionable insights to manage chronic diseases and balance calorie in and out. WELT is the most natural wearable for healthcare, and is both fashionable and functional, made for everyday life and everyday outfits. As the stylish alternative to previous belt or fitness trackers, WELT provides the most natural user experience.

          WELT allows users to check their condition more accurately and take the necessary measures whether by themselves or through healthcare providers.

          <h6>Result 1: <br>Service Effectivity </h6>
          According to user testimonials and data, WELT is shown to be actually effective in reducing waist circumference overtime. 
            <!-- <br><br>*Waist size is the most absolute metric of obesity. According to WHO, a male adult with waist circumference larger than 90cm is obese regardless of his weight and height. Because two men with different waist size can still have same weight, health information from only the weight data can be misleading.
 -->       
          <h6>Result 2: <br> User Retention Rate</h6>
          WELT's natural UX and balanced monitoring assures user's continuous use of product than most other tracking devices.<br>

          <h5>Collaborative Business Model</h5>

          <h4>3_ <br> Product Development</h4>
          <h5>Sketch & Wireframes</h5>
          Product: The major focus was ‘invisibility’ of technology - to hide technology to have finishing look of a fashion item. Also, it was important to show an impression of WELT brand without being visually loud.
          Service: Kept minimal depths, simple interface elements, and intuitive UX. It was especially tricky to transfer physical product into graphic element, while eliminating unnessesary procedures. In pairing procedure, the device is automatically waken and ready to pair when user wears the belt, solved by using BLE and Hall sensor. When cutting belt leather to adjust to user's own waist size, user simply applies the same number engraved on leather on to the app.
