          <h6>Origami-inspired Pnuematically Deployable Pillar<br>
          Title: Head Designer<br>
          2016.4-2017.8</h6>
          <p>Role: <br>Managed WELT project across research, HW and SW product development, mass production and sale. Direct and designed WELT's design outcomes including UX, product, GUI, brand identity, packaging and promotional design.</p>
          <p>WELT Corporation is a spin-off healthcare venture project from Samsung Electronics Creative Lab. Its product, <u>Smart belt, is a world's first belt wearable healthcare solution for obesity and metabolic syndrome.</u> Currently, WELT is reaching a significant global sales in fashion and healthcare market.</p>
          
          <br><br><br><br>
          <h5>IoT + Healthcare + Fashion</h5>
          <p>Octa Pillar was inspired by two things: octagonal, 3D origami and the magnitude of pillars in an urban setting. In researching materials and studying the geometry to make this shape able to transition from a flat state to an inflated state, we found that differences in angles thwart the structure to collapse fully. Moving up in scale from our earlier chipboard models, the final model was made in corrugated plastic at the size of 2.5 feet by 8.5 feet. Using hot melt glue and recycling bags as an air-tight seal, the segments were joined together to form a deployable surface. Lastly, a remotely controllable lighting was installed before sealing. Octa Pillar can be utilized in deployable structures ranging from a short-term event decorum in public spaces to structural foundations of a tent.

          <h5>Branding & Packaging</h5>
          <p>Brand language is minimal yet stylish to fit high end fashion product.

          <h4>Concept Development</h4>
          <h5>Problem - health </h5>
          <p>Metabolic syndrome results from bad health habits, and is a shortcut to chronic disease and obesity. It raises chances of chronic disease such as diabetes and hypertension to four times. According to American College of Preventive Medicine, 1 in 3 adults are suffering with metabolic syndrome. To prevent metabolic syndrome, potential patients need accurate diagnosis and continuous treatment on a daily basis. </p>
          <p>Waist circumference is a powerful basis to detect overweight and obesity, and it is a major diagnostic indicator for various health risks. Treatment for metabolic syndrome is prescribed through controlled exercise, and eating habits.</p>
          <br><br><br>
          <h5>Problem - market</h5>
          <p>Wearable health tracker is the most effective method to deliver healthcare providers the detailed and continuous log of patient's health habits that they accrue overtime. However the critical problems in existing fitness trackers make them difficult to provide customized treatment.
            <br><br>Although there are many fitness bands and smart watches that intend to monitor daily health logs,
          	<br><br>1. 33% of activity trackers are abandoned within 6 months due to <u>uncomfortable UX</u>. 
          	<br><br>2. <u>majority focus ONLY on tracking activity level (calorie burn)</u>, only 1 of the 3 measures that should be monitored to prevent weight gain.
  
          <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>    
          <h5>Solution - Comprehensive Healthcare Service </h5>
          <p>Monitoring unique health data obtained in waist area including waist circumference, food consumption pattern, activity and inactivity levels, the service aims to provide personalized healthcare with actionable insights to manage chronic diseases and balance calorie in and out. WELT is the most natural wearable for healthcare, and is both fashionable and functional, made for everyday life and everyday outfits. As the stylish alternative to previous belt or fitness trackers, WELT provides the most natural user experience. </p>

          WELT allows users to check their condition more accurately and take the necessary measures whether by themselves or through healthcare providers.

          <h4>Product Development</h4>
          <h5>Sketch & Wireframes</h5>
          <p>Product: The major focus was ‘invisibility’ of technology - to hide technology to have finishing look of a fashion item. Also, it was important to show an impression of WELT brand without being visually loud.</p>
          <p>Service: Kept minimal depths, simple interface elements, and intuitive UX. It was especially tricky to transfer physical product into graphic element, while eliminating unnessesary procedures. In pairing procedure, the device is automatically waken and ready to pair when user wears the belt, solved by using BLE and Hall sensor. When cutting belt leather to adjust to user's own waist size, user simply applies the same number engraved on leather on to the app.</p>

          <p>Test durability and aesthetics by experimenting <br> with various textures of leather</p>
          <br><br><br><br>
          <h5>Hardware & Factory Mass Production</h5>
          <p> I managed quality control through all supply chains including: testing functions in PCB, quality controlling injection molded buckle, sensor-embedded leather, package, managing storage and shipping </p>
          <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

          <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
          <h5>Service Effectivity </h5>
          <p> According to user testimonials and data, WELT is shown to be actually effective in reducing waist circumference overtime. 
            <br><br>*Waist size is the most absolute metric of obesity. According to WHO, a male adult with waist circumference larger than 90cm is obese regardless of his weight and height. Because two men with different waist size can still have same weight, health information from only the weight data can be misleading.</p>
          <br><br>
          <h5>User Retention Rate</h5>
          <p>WELT's natural UX and balanced monitoring assures user's continuous use of product than most other tracking devices.</p><br>

          <h5>Helsinki Slush Conference 2016 interview</h5>
          <p>Q: How does WELT work? <br> Our basic algorithm for example (for) eating habits, we try to provide a look into the whole context of the variation of your waist circumference. So, just by extending your belly won't instantly change the calories for your intake, but we would consider the whole context of what you've been doing.</p>
